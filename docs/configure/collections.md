# :material-collage: Collections

In addition to the systems displayed; EmulationStation (ES) has functionality to create custom collections that you can use to group and organize your game library in different ways.  For example; if you wanted to create a view that automatically grouped all of your Role Playing Games you can use ES collections to do that. 

There are 3 collection types in ES and this page will walk through each to help you decide which makes sense for you to use for your use cases.
