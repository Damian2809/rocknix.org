# Scraping

Scraping allows you to download metadata, images and videos for your games, as well as manuals and sometimes even game maps.

To scrape games, your deivce needs an internet connection, and you’ll also need to create to create an account on [ScreenScraper](https://screenscraper.fr/). 

Once you have a Screenscraper account, press Start to access the Main Menu, then go to Scraper. Enter your username and password in the Username and Password fields. Using the checkboxes, select which resources you want to get when scraping. Preview images are downloaded automatically, and so are the game’s metadata (title, release date, developer, etc).
