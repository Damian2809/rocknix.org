## Instructions

### 1. Firmware Setup

!!! note "RPCS3 requires official PS3 firmware to be installed through RPCS3's GUI before you can run games. Its recommended to have a mouse/keyboard plugged in for these steps to make it easier to navigate RPCS3's GUI."

1. Download the latest official PS3 firmware from Sony's [PS3 System Software](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/) page. *(The downloaded file will be named `PS3UPDAT.PUP`)*
2. Transfer the `PS3UPDAT.PUP` file to `/storage/roms/temp`.  If the `temp` folder does not exist then please create it *(you will delete this file after you have installed it)*.
3. Navigate to the Tools system and then select ++"Start RPCS3"++. This will open the RPCS3 GUI where you will install the firmware you downloaded above.
4. Select `File > Install Firmware.`
5. Navigate to `~/storage/roms/temp`, select `PS3UPDAT.PUP` and press `Open`

The firmware will be installed and then a window will open to process the needed files; please let this process complete.  Once complete you can close out RPCS3 and return to EmulationStation. You can also delete `PS3UPDAT.PUP` from `/storage/roms/temp` to free up space.

### 2. Game Setup

PS3 games are available in two formats: Disc-Based Games and Digital PSN Packages. The steps for setting up a given game differ depending on its source format.

#### Disc-Based Games
RPCS3 works with decrypted ISO files stored in a folder format so you will need to convert your discs to this format before they can be read by the emulator.

##### Steps:
1. Follow [these instructions](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Dumping_PlayStation_3_games#Using_a_compatible_Blu-ray_drive_with_PC_to_dump_disc_games) from RPCS3's wiki to dump and decrypt your PS3 disc *(recommended: follow the instructions for using [ps3-disc-dumper](https://github.com/13xforever/ps3-disc-dumper/releases))*.
2. Add a `.ps3` extension to the end of the folder name that was generated by ps3-disc-dumper.
3. Upload that folder (with the .ps3 extension) to `storage/roms/ps3`
``` bash title="Example Folder Structure"
/storage/roms/ps3/
    └─ Game name.ps3/
        ├─ PS3_GAME/
        │  ├─ LICDIR/
        │  ├─ TROPDIR/ (trophy data)
        │  ├─ USRDIR/ (the main game data)
        │  ├─ ICON0.PNG
        │  ├─ PARAM.SFO
        │  ├─ PIC0.PNG
        │  ├─ PS3LOGO.DAT
        │  └─ (various other metadata files)
        ├─ PS3_UPDATE/ (built-in firmware update, if applicable)
        └─ PS3_DISC.SFB
```
4. Refresh EmulationStation by pressing ++"START"++ to open the Main Menu then select `Game Settings > Update Gamelists`.  

Once complete you should now see your game in the PS3 gamelist.

*Coming Soon*

### 3. Running a Game

On the first boot of a game, RPCS3 will compile its PPU modules. This can take a long time so please have patience as its required to run the game. Allowing RPCS3 to do this will also make all future launches of the game much quicker.

On first boot you will get the RPCS3 welcome screen. Its recommended to check the box in the bottom right labled "Do not show again" (this will stop this screen showing up for future launches).  Check the "I have read the Quickstart guide" box and then select the continue button that shows up at the bottom left of the screen. 

To exit a game and return to EmulationStation you can either (1) press the ++"GUIDE"++ button on your controller to open up RPCS3's menu and select `Exit` or (2) Press ++"L1"++ + ++"SELECT"++ + ++"START"++
