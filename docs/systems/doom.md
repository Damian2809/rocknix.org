## Creating `.doom` files

These files must be created for each **WAD** that you want to load with gzdoom. The file should contain at least one `IWAD` variable and optional `MOD` variables. Multiple `IWAD` and `MOD` variables can be used in the same file to load multiple wads, mods and packages. Therefore, multiple **.doom** files can be created for the same **WAD** for each configuration of the game. 

It is recommended to store **WAD** files in a `\iwads` subfolder and **MODs** in a `\mods` subfolder. You would then include the path to each file in the **.doom** file (see examples below)

``` bash title="Example Folder Structure"
/roms/doom/
    ├─ doom2.doom
    ├─ heretic-mod.doom
    ├─ iwads/
    │   ├─ doom2.wad
    │   ├─ heretic.wad
    │   └─ IWMPP_Heretic.wad
    └─ mods/
        ├─ precise-crosshair-v1.4.1.pk3
        └─ target-spy-v2.0.1.pk3
```

### Example: Doom 2 (no mods)

`/roms/doom/doom2.doom` would contain
```
IWAD=iwads/doom2.wad
```
to load vanilla Doom 2

!!! note "don't leave any space between `GRP` or `PATH` and `=` and enclose filenames containing spaces with "quotes""

### Example: Heretic (with mods)

Example: `/roms/doom/heretic-mod.doom` would contain
```
IWAD=iwads/heretic.wad
IWAD=iwads/IWMPP_Heretic.wad
MOD=mods/precise-crosshair-v1.4.1.pk3
MOD=mods/target-spy-v2.0.1.pk3
-- end --
```
to load Heretic with additional patches and mods.

!!! note "add `-- end --` to the end of the file when it contains multiple lines"
