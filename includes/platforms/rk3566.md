### Tweaks

In Emulationstation system settings you find an overclock setting and undervolt options. The overlock option enables 2 GHz operation. While there are 3 levels of undervolting, where L1 is the least undervolt and L3 is the most undervolt. Undervolting can help performance in higher end emulators such as PPSSPP and Yabasanshiro standalone, due to less thermal throttling. As well as less battery drain on lower end emulators.

Obviously it can't be guaranteed that all specimens can undervolt and hence you may end up with a non-booting or unstable system. If this is occurs, the undervolting can be reversed by:

1. Inserting the OS SD card into a PC.
2. Open ROCKNIX partition, and go to the extlinux folder.
3. Open extlinux.conf text file.
4. Completely remove the line that starts with `FDTOVERLAYS`.
5. Now your device will boot with stock voltages.
